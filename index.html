    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a college student pursuing Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). I am focus to be skillful in terms of programming, networking, and system technology. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am interested in learning about other stuff, such as crimes and laws of the Philippines. I also have the ability to create emotional poetry that conveys emotions and concepts through imagination through art.<br>
        <br>
        On the technical side, I gained a basic understanding of web development, including proficiency in HTML and CSS. Also, knowing Java will expand your programming skills. Complementing these skills, I became involved in UI/UX design and honed my ability to create user interfaces with excellence.
